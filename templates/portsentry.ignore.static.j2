# Keep 127.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.0 to keep people from playing games.
# Put hosts in here you never want blocked. This includes the IP addresses
# of all local interfaces on the protected host (i.e virtual host, mult-home)
# Keep 127.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.0 to keep people from playing games.

# Upon start of portsentry(8) via /etc/init.d/portsentry this file

# PortSentry can support full netmasks for networks as well. Format is:
#
# <IP Address>/<Netmask>
#
# Example:
#
# 192.168.2.0/24
# 192.168.0.0/16
# 192.168.2.1/32
# Etc.
#
# If you don't supply a netmask it is assumed to be 32 bits.
#
#
#  First we've got base addresses
